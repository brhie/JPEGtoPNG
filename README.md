# JPEGtoPNG
This python script changes every image file in a folder to PNG formate and saves it to a folder.
You need Python3 installed and Pillow library in order to use this

1. Place this Python file in the same folder as your folder containing image files. In this case, Pokedex.

2. Run this script. But when doing so, make sure the first argument is the JPEG folder 
and the second argument is where the changed PNG files are going. When there isn't a target folder, it will create one

ex) python3 JPEGtoPNGconverter.py Pokedex test
